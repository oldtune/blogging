Configuration in .NET

## What are Configuration and Why do we need it?
To put it simple, configuration are just way to tweak the application (UI or behavior) before running the application.
There are 2 types of configurations, Hot and cold configuration

## Hot Configuration
Hot configuration is the type of configuration that doesn't require an app restart upon changing the configuration.
## Cold configuration
Oppose to Hot configuration, cold configuration requires an app restart to apply new config.
